## Purpose

We will develop an embedded system that will calculate the temperature in the morning. 
We will use the temperature sensor which will detect the temperature. Then we will use the speaker to output the audio. Code will automatically execute at certain time every morning.

## Initial Design Plan

- Hardware components we will be using are temperature detector and speaker.
  
  - calculate temparature and implement correct audio for temparature in certain ranges. 
 
## Files

- We have license file, image file, and ReadMe. License file is a copyright file. Image file has an example image. ReadMe has all the instrustion about the embedded system we are developing.

## Summary

Provide a brief summary description of the design and implementation,
including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result
you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in
accomplishing these results, including any challenges overcome and
innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment.
This section should be no more than three paragraphs.
